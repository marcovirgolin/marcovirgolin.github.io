## Research Interests
My main research interest are two <em><b>E</b></em>s of Machine Learning (ML): **Explainable**- and **Evolutionary**-ML. 

Explainable ML concerns (i) explaining the behavior of normally opaque or black-box ML models; and (ii) algorithms capable of generating interpretable ML models. Understanding why an ML model behaves the way it does can provide important insights on the problem at hand as well as trust to use it in sensitive applications (e.g., cancer treatment).

Evolutionary ML uses evolutionary computation (my main expertise is [Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming)) to generate ML models directly, or in synergy with other ML techniques.

I am also interested in human-machine interaction and in medical applications of ML.
