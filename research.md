# Research

## Research Interests
My main research interest are two <em><b>E</b></em>s of Machine Learning (ML): **Explainable**- and **Evolutionary**-ML. 

Explainable ML concerns explaining the meaning of normally uninterpretable ML models, and also techniques to directly generate interpretable ML models. Understanding what an ML model mean can provide not only important insights on the problem at hand, but also confidence in using the model's predictions, specially when dealing with delicate applications (e.g., cancer treatment).

Evolutionary ML uses evolutionary computation (my main expertise is [Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming)) to directly generate ML models, or in synergy with other ML techniques.

I am also interested in medical applications of ML, and have experience with pediatric radiation therapy.


<!--## Working papers
I am currently working on the following papers:
- _Improving and Explaining Machine Learning by Evolving Interpretable Features_
- _Improving Semantic Backpropagation for Symbolic Regression with Semantic Compression and Unbiased Sampling_
- _Automatic Generation of Highly Individualized Pediatric Phantoms from Data_
