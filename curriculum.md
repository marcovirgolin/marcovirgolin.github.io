## Other Experience
- ### 2017 **Electronic Media Chair for GECCO 2017**
I worked on back-end, front-end, and maintance of the website and social pages of the <a href="http://gecco-2017.sigevo.org/index.html" target="_blank">Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference 2017</a>. A noteworthy contribution is the proposal of a new style that would fit and modernize the website of the conference (<a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/themes/shapely/" target="_blank">shapely theme</a>). From 2017 onwards, GECCO's website has a new face :) 

- ### 2014 - 2015 **Voluteer for ASsociazione TRiestina Ospedaliera (ASTRO)**
I was keeping company and entertaining hospitalized children at the pediatric hospital "Burlo Garofalo" in Trieste, Italy

- ### 2012 - 2014 **Member of Electronical Engineering STudents' European assoCiation (EESTEC)**
I helped with the organization of recreational international summer schools and was first responsible for the organization of few events, among which a seminar on job opportunities after the studies (_What's Next_, speakers eng. Erni Durdevic, eng. Giorgio Faustini, prof. Eric Medvet), and a seminar on Machine Learning (_Machine Learning_, speaker dr. Andrea de Lorenzo).
