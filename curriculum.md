## Other Experience
- ### 2017 **Electronic Media Chair for GECCO 2017**
I worked on back-end, front-end, and maintance of the website and social pages of the <a href="http://gecco-2017.sigevo.org/index.html" target="_blank">Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference 2017</a>. A noteworthy contribution is the proposal of a new style that would fit and modernize the website of the conference (<a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/themes/shapely/" target="_blank">shapely theme</a>). From 2017 onwards, GECCO's website has a new face :)
